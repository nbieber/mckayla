McKayla is not impressed with random images as you browse the web.

A Chrome Extension that randomly overlays the [in]famous 'McKayla Is Not Impressed' image over other images while you browse.
McKayla can be found on approximately 20% of images - a number I like to refer to as "the McKayla threshold."

Prank your friends by installing it on their machines when they're not looking!
